# SALES ANALYSIS USING POWER BI

## Project Overview
  This project is the outcome of a  decriptive research on past, present, and future of a fictitious Electronic Retail Company. It focuses on using business analytics to create effective marketing strategies by analyzing data with tools like PowerBI and  DAX query language. The project aims to demonstrate how PowerBI can be used for sales analysis and dashboard creation, making it user-friendly. I created dashboards to understand trends, business performance, and identify top-selling devices in specific states. The project turns large datasets into visualizations to help with decision-making in business.

## Data Sources
**Excel Workbook**- Data exported from Kaggle.com

## Data Modelling

Power BI automatically established connections among the relevant tables, leading to the creation of a star schema model. The **Sales_Data** serves as the central fact table in this model, comprising 15,001 rows and 11 columns. The remaining tables, such as Sales_Channel, Sales_Product, Sales_Product_Sub_Cat, Sales_Promotion, and Sales_State, function as dimension tables. These dimension tables are linked to the "Sales_Data" table through shared columns.

## Data Visualization
In this process I converted data into visualization to visually display collected data by using various charts, graphs and other visualization types. The reports consist of two pages.
